# Implementation-of-queue-using-2-stacks

1. Optimized for Limited Data Structures
In certain environments or constraints (e.g., embedded systems or platforms with limited libraries), only stacks may be available as a built-in data structure. By combining two stacks, you can simulate queue behavior (FIFO) effectively.
2. Space Efficiency
Two stacks do not require additional memory beyond their intrinsic storage needs. They allow queue operations without using extra arrays or linked lists, making them suitable for systems where memory is a critical resource.
3. Algorithmic Use Cases
This approach is often seen in algorithms where stack-like behavior is primary, but queue-like behavior is occasionally required. For example:
Undo-redo operations in text editors: One stack can represent the current state, and the second stack can represent the redo operations.
Function call management: Queues simulated with stacks can help manage certain recursive or backtracking algorithms.
4. Concurrency Control
When designing thread-safe data structures, it may be easier to implement locking mechanisms for stacks. Using two stacks to implement a queue can simplify the locking strategy compared to a single shared queue.
5. Amortized Efficiency
The two-stack approach provides amortized O(1) for enqueue and amortized O(1) for dequeue operations, which is competitive with direct implementations of queues.

Conclusion
We use two stacks instead of a queue in scenarios where:

Stacks are the only or better-supported data structure.
Thread-safety or architecture benefits align with stacks.
Functional programming paradigms favor immutable operations.
